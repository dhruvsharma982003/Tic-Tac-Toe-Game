# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A Tic Tac Toe game project typically involves creating a simple two-player game where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (usually "X" and "O"). The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
